### Converting Numerical data of type char to double

The numerical data columns are of the type 'char'. And the values are of
the form "xxxM" and "xxxK". So we need to extract the Ms and Ks then
replace them with "", convert the data types to "double" and store the
modified data in new columns (we don't want to modify existing columns
because they might need to be used or other analysis)

```{r}
#loading the data
library(tidyverse)
df<-read_csv("worksheet/top_1000_instagrammers.csv")

#Function to separate M and K from numbers and convert the data type from character to double
sepMK<-function(column)
{
  for(i in 1:length(column))
  {
    len<-nchar(column[i])
    subst<-substring(column[i],len,len)
    
    if(subst=="M"){
      
      new<-str_replace(column[i],"M","")
      new<-as.double(new)
      new<-new*1000000
      column[i]<-new
      
    }else if(subst=="K"){
      
      new<-str_replace(column[i],"K","")
      new<-as.double(new)
      new<-new*1000
      column[i]<-new
      
    }else if(subst==0){
      
      new<-0
      column[i]<-0
      
    }
  }
  return(as.double(column))#return the data column as double datatype
}#end of function

#creating a new column to store the modified data
df$'Authentic_Engagement_num'<-sepMK(df$'Authentic Engagement')
df$'Followers_num'<-sepMK(df$'Followers')
df$'Engagement_Avg_num'<-sepMK(df$'Engagement Avg.')
```

### Problem 1

Get the summary statistics (mean, median, mode, min, max, 1st quartile,
3rd quartile and standard deviation) for the dataset. Calculate these
only for the numerical columns [Audience Country, Authentic Engagement
and Engagement Average]. What can you determine from the summary
statistics? How does your Instagram stats hold up with the top 1000 :P ?

**Solution:**

```{r}

#Function to find mode
Mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}

#Finding the summary statistics of:
#1.Followers
min(df$'Followers_num')
max(df$'Followers_num')
mean(df$'Followers_num')
median(df$'Followers_num')
Mode(df$'Followers_num')
quantile(df$'Followers_num',0.25)#1st quartile
quantile(df$'Followers_num',0.75)#3rd quartile
sd(df$'Followers_num')

#2.Authentic Engagement
min(df$'Authentic_Engagement_num')
max(df$'Authentic_Engagement_num')
mean(df$'Authentic_Engagement_num')
median(df$'Authentic_Engagement_num')
Mode(df$'Authentic_Engagement_num')
quantile(df$'Authentic_Engagement_num',0.25)#1st quartile
quantile(df$'Authentic_Engagement_num',0.75)#3rd quartile
sd(df$'Authentic_Engagement_num')

#3.Engagement Average
min(df$'Engagement_Avg_num')
max(df$'Engagement_Avg_num')
mean(df$'Engagement_Avg_num')
median(df$'Engagement_Avg_num')
Mode(df$'Engagement_Avg_num')
quantile(df$'Engagement_Avg_num',0.25)#1st quartile
quantile(df$'Engagement_Avg_num',0.75)#3rd quartile
sd(df$'Engagement_Avg_num')

#end of summary statistics


```

We can see that the standard deviation is greater than mean in all the
cases.This means that there is high variation between values and thus
the data is scattered. Thus mean is not a good option to describe the
data. In case of "Followers","Authentic Engagement" and "Engagement
Average", mean\>median, which implies that the data is likely
rightly-skewed for them. The mode, 1st percentile and 3rd percentile are
as seen above. I'm not an influencer on Instagram and since I don't make
any posts(and my account is private), I think there is no engagement on
my account :P . But I do think that in case of a private account, the
maximum engagement would be less than or equal to the number of
followers of that account.

### Problem 2

Create a histogram where the x-axis contains the Audience Country and
y-axis contains the total follower count of all users in that country.
Which country has the most amount of followers? (Hint) Use a dictionary
to maintain the sum of followers across countries. What is the total for
India and what rank does it fall compared to other countries?

**Solution:**

```{r}

#Problem2
#Plotting an 'Audience Country vs Follower count' Bar Graph
#PLEASE NOTE THAT THE FOLLOWER COUNT IS THE SUM OF FOLLOWERS CORRESPONDING TO THE COUNTRY

country<-df$'Audience Country'
country<-country[!is.na(country)]
xaxis<-unique(country)
print(xaxis)#to check if all the unique elements are stored in the variable 'xaxis'

#Function to find the sum of all followers corresponding to a country and storing them in a vector
folsum<-function(countr,xaxis,datfolnew){ 
  #'xaxis' contains all the unique country names
  #'countr' is a vector containing the country names with repetition
  #'datfol' is a vector containing the all the corresponding followers
  
  y<-c()
  for(i in 1:length(xaxis)){
    s<-0
    for(j in 1:length(countr)){
      if((xaxis[i] == countr[j])){
        s<-s+datfolnew[j]
      }
    }
    y[i]<-s
  }
  return(y)
}
#Storing the return value in a variable 'yaxis'
yaxis<-folsum(country,xaxis,df$'Followers_num')

print(yaxis)

#Plotting the graph using barplot()
barplot(yaxis,names.arg=xaxis,las = 2,
        cex.names = 0.7,xlab="Audience Country",ylab="Follower Count",main="Bar Graph: 'Audience Country vs Follower Count' ")
```

![](images/p2s3.png)

![](images/p2s2-01.png)

It can be seen from the graph that United States has the highest
follower count with India being the next. From the picture above the
graph, we see that India is at the second rank with a total of
5876500000 follower count.

### Problem 3

Create a horizontal box plot using the column [Authentic Engagement].
What inferences can you make from this box and whisker plot?

**Solution:**

```{r}

#Problem 3
#Plotting a horizontal box plot
x<-df$'Authentic_Engagement_num'
boxplot(x,horizontal=TRUE,xlab="Authentic Engagement",main="Box Plot")
```

![](images/p3s1.png)

![](images/p3s2-01.png)

It can be inferred from the box plot above that the data is skewed
(since the line inside the box(the median) is not in the center). We can
also see that there are a lot of outliers. But this is not surprising
considering the fact that our data is a highly scattered one. We can
also infer that a lot of influencers have less engagement(even 0)
despite large following. The large following could be because of Fake
engagement concept in Instagram one of the consequences of which is
sudden rise in number of followers or spammed comments.

## Conclusion

In a few short sentences, describe your Instagram profile (category,
followers, estimated engagement). Compare your profile to the analysis
done of the top 1000 profiles. If you were tasked to becoming an
influencer, what would be the best way for you to increase your
followers and user engagement?

**Solution:**

My instagram account has no category since its only for personal uses.
Since I am not an influencer and my Instagram account is private
(approx. 120 followers), the estimated engagement I think would be less
than or equal to the number of followers I have.

If I were tasked with becoming and influencer, I would post consistently
because Instagram's algorithm ensures steady increase in followers and
authentic engagement with regular posts, use captions that are are
interactive so people interact in the comment section thereby increasing
engagement. I would also connect and collaborate with other influencers
which would have an added advantage of attracting the users that are
interested in their account.
